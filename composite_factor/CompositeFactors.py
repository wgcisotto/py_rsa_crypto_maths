def pollards_rho(n):
    """
    Factorizes a positive integer 'n' using Pollard's Rho algorithm.

    This function attempts to find the prime factors of 'n' by iteratively applying Pollard's Rho algorithm,
    which is a probabilistic algorithm for integer factorization. It is particularly efficient for
    factoring large composite numbers.

    Parameters:
    n (int): The positive integer to be factorized.

    Returns:
    List[int]: A list of prime factors of 'n' in ascending order.

    Example:
    >>> pollards_rho(35)
    [5, 7]
    >>> pollards_rho(143)
    [11, 13]
    >>> pollards_rho(19)
    [19]

    Note:
    - The function may return the factors in an arbitrary order.
    - If 'n' is a prime number, the function will return the prime number itself in a list.
